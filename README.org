#+TITLE: Yt-Com

*Reliable* YouTube comments front-end for Emacs.

* Usage
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x yt-com
  #+end_src

  ~yt-com~ takes a YouTube (or Invidious) URL or ID of a video.

* Reliable?
  Yes, this is what this package tries to achieve.  Invidious instances are not
  very reliable.  They go down and fail to respond from time to time.  This
  package tries to mitigate this problem by querying a *LIST* of invidious
  instances.  It sequentially tries to request data from every invidious
  instance and returns as soon as it gets a response without an error.  And, of
  course, it is asynchronous!

* Why only YouTube comments?
  Why not a full-blown front-end for YouTube?  Well, since I discovered that
  invidious instances work very well with only HTML enabled, I just use /EWW/
  for browsing them.  It dose require JavaScript for comments tho.
